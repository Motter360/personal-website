personal website v. 1.0.0, published 10/26/2023

Hello! Welcome to my personal website! It's been a long journey to get here, and I'm so excited to share it with you. My philosophy has been to create the smallest piece of value I can, then push it to production as quickly as possible. As such, when you look through my code, you may find sections that are empty. Think of these as expansions yet to come! 

Without further ado, the patch notes:

- added the following sections to the website:
    - Navigation bar
    - Introduction
    - About Me
    - Get in touch
- completed styling for both small and large screens
- updated the read me
